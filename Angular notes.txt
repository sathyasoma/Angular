Development environment:
========================

Editor:
-------
 visual studio code 
 
 You need to choose an editor for creating your angular projects. 
 You can choose any editor of your choice including any editions of Visual 
 Studio, Eclipse, Atom etc.

We will be using Visual Studio code as our editor. Visual studio code is 
an open source project and free to use. It can run on Windows, Linux & 
OS X. It has IntelliSense support, easy integration with Git and support 
for debugging the applications. It has a great support for Typescript.

Install package manager:
-------------------------
To install ngular and depencies , we are going to NODE PACKAGE MANAGAER
OR "npm".

   Node package manager:
   -----------------------
   The NPM is a Package Manager similar to what NuGet is for Visual Studio.
It is the Package manager of choice for the Javascript projects. 
NPM is used to install libraries, Packages & applications from Public 
repositories.
    why it is Required:
	--------------------
	We are going to use NPM to install Angular, Typescript, and any other 
packages/modules required by our application. NPM is can be used to 
upgrade these packages as and when necessary. Without NPM, we have to 
download and install all these packages manually.

   installing NPM:
   ----------------
   you need to install npm on your machine if it is already installed.

NPM installed as a part of the NODEJS.


CHOOSE LANGUAGE:
==============
IF you want to create angular application you need to write one language
qi.e javascript,typescript,dart, etc

  Now a days Typscript is popular to creqate angualr application.
  
    what is typscript?
	-----------------
	   The "Typescript" is superset of "javascript" 
	        the code written in typescript cannot be used directly on the browser
it must be compiled tp javascript before running on web browser.
		this process isa called  "Transpilling".
      Typescript is opensource langauge, maintained by "MICROSOFT".

Features of Typescript:
-----------------------
  it supports for modules, classes, interfaces, generics	
  it support all curent versions of "javascript" ES6, ES2015.
  It can transpile either ES6 or ES2015.


Along with angular cli typescript can be installed.

Installing Angular:
------------------------
we install angual by using Angular command line interface(CLI)

Angular CLI helps to create angular application with all packages,files
with on esingle command.

    to install:
               
              npm install -g @angular/cli

    to find version:  ng --version


The Angular CLI creates the Angular Application and uses Typescript, 
Webpack ( for Module bundling), Karma ( for unit testing), 
Protractor ( for an end to end testing).

creating a new angualr appliation:
===================================

Generate a new project : ng new my-app      
                                  
								   (my-app is the project name)
								   
Go to the project Directory: cd my-app

Launches the server: ng serve
																				
																					
 The above command compiles the angular application and invokes the 
"WEBPACK development server".
   The server keep on eye on the project and when you change any thing in the project
it compiles project again.

The webpack developemnt server listen on the HTTP port 4200 
   Hence open the browser and type http://localhost:4200/ and you will see GettingStarted app 
is running displayed on the browser. 
  
Architecture of Angular:
-----------------------
   Building blocks of Angular:
    ------------------
	           Modules
			   Components
			   Metadata
			   Templates
			   DataBinding
			   Directives
			   Services

Modules:
---------
Angular appliation is modular in nature.
    in each module we have components, directives, pipes, services
Every angualr we have one deflut module that is root module,

Component:
---------
Angua;r 4 is the component based 
Encapsulates the template, data and behaviour of view.
  Every angualr application has one major component i.e root component.
  
A component needs that a view for that we need "Template"

Template:
---------
Acomponent nedds to have view.To define a view , you can define templates.

A template is a form of  HTML that tells angualr how to render the component.

Metadata:
---------
Metadata tells Angular how to process a class.

you must add metadata to your code so that angualr knows what to do.

DatBinding
--------------
Angualr supports databinding , a mechanism for coordinating parts of a 
template with parts of a component.

Directives:
----------
Angualr templates are "dynamic" . 
   when angualr renders them, it transforms the DOM according to the 
instructions given by diectives.

<div highlight> Highlite me....</div>

Services:
----------
Angualr service is a class that encapsulates some sort of functiinality and 
provides its s service for the rest of your application.	
			   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Bootstrap:
  ==========
  
  if you want to add bootsrap style to yur angular project how?
  
  goto-->getbootsrap.com-->copy cdn link--->css, poppper.js, j query, we can copy links
  
  otherway to add depencies:
  ---------------
  open new terminal
        npm install jquery popper.js
		
		npm install bootsrap
