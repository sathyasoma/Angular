Introduction:
=============
 Angular is an open source javascript binding framework to build web applications.(client side)
 
 Angular binds model with view architecture
 
 angular helps to implemnt MVVM(MODEL view view model) pattern
 
 angular is used to develop SPAs (Single page applications)
 
 angular helps to load parts of webpages asynchronously rather tahn loading entire page.
 
 By design, angular promates "modular approach" and hence  the application wil havw clear structure.
 
 by using components feature , we have a lot re-useble code
 
 with the help of angulars inbuilt capabilities like validtiton , routing the development become
 quicker and easier.
 
 In angular it is possible  to do unit test and easily maintain the code
 
 angular is the product of google team and makes us of type script language from microsoft.
 
 versions;
 =========
 
 1 to 10
 
 10.0.4
 10==>major(twise a year it can change)
 0==>major parts upadates
 4==>bugs upadat
 
 
 IF you want learn ANGULAER you knows
             basics  of
			 
			 html
			 css
			 javscript
			 type script

TypeScript:
===========


Type script is an open sorce pure object oriented language.

itis a strongly typed superset of java script,which compiles  to palin java scripts

it is developed and maintained by microsoft under Apache licence

it is not run directly on the browser, it needs a compiler  to compile and generate a java 
script file(uses v8 engine)

typescript sorce file  is in .ts extension

Type script was designed by "Anderes Hejlsberg" designer of c# at microsoft.

finally
      typescript = javascript+some additional features.


advantages:
==========
type script always highlets the error at compile time, but in the javascripts errors 
are hilghlets at run tume.

type script suport strongly types or static typing , whereas this is not in javascript.

types scripts run on any browser

it has name space concept by defining a module


Disadvantages:
==============

type script takes long time to compile the code.

type script doesnot support abstract classes

To run Type script application in browser , a compilation step is required  to transform Type script
to java script.



Installation and how to start:
================================
Required develpment enivironment:
-------------------------------

Node
  - node is javascript runtime environment built in chrome's v8 javascript engine.
  
Npm 
  -npm is a package managaer for the javascript programming language.
  
.Angular ClI

Text editor 
   visula studio code
	

* 1st install node js

 open cmd and check weather its installed or not
          type     npm --version  (it will show 6.4.13 like this) installed succesfully
		  
		  next
		  ti install npm type in cmd 
		  npm install -g @angular/cli
		     weather installed or not   open cmd and type 
			      ng --version
				     it will show version


==> open the visula studio
  create a new folder (angular 10)
       click on terminal==> new terminal
	   
	   bottom--> ng new hello world(project name)  =>enter=> yes/ no ==>type n(no)
	   
	   select stylesheet= >css==>enter
         
		 after that in your folder hello wrld file is seen>
		 
		 execution: ng serve
		 
		 it will shown compiled suucessfully
		 
		 open browser:  localhost:4200
		                   it will show your projrct
						   

Architecture:
===============
module:
=======
    it is the first building blockof angular application
	angular apps are modular in nature
	angular applications is a collecction of individual modules
	every module represents a feature area in angular
	
	Application:
	   user module related to                       admin module related to application
	   application user                                administartors.

  Every angular application has atleast only one module, known as root-module.
  
  -By convention this is called as "app-module"
  
  -Each module made up of components and services



 
how to create new component:
===========================
go to terminal bottom:
         i want generate student component.
		     
			 ng g c student   press enter    ->       here g(generate) c (component)
		
app-student component created

go to student.component.ts  -->select the "selector"=app-student ->copy ->paste in 
                                                                      ->app.component.html
   go to student.componet.html-->write what you need tags  and ->save
      go to student.component.css-->apply the styles for for classe in html   -->save
           	  
     
Interpolation:
============


if i want to create html,css,ts file in single file we have to write
i want crete test component with in a single file i have css,html,ts

command==>  ng g c test -it -is --skipTest=true
                       (it= inline template:: is=inline styles)

     
styele tag:  
   if you want write style tags in css single file use in between ``


interpolation is used for make dynamic content. UI

 for that what we need to do
 
 
 write in the class
 
      public name="sathya prakash";
	       place this name in where you want use in  -->{{name}}
    
 above this called "binding"  one way binding
          
		  one way binding:(it will go only class to view)
		  ---------------
		  
		  class ---------------------------------> view
      public name="";                   <p> welcome to {{name}} </p>


conacatnation:
------------------

binding expression:{{}}

  {{"welcome to :" +name}}



  <p>{{name.length}}</p> // 14

  <p>{{name.toUpperCase()}}</p>     //SATHYA PRAKASH	
  
  
  by using method:
  ------------------
  
  userName(){
     
	return  "welcome to :" +this.name;
	  
  }
  
  
  disadvtges of interpolation:
  ===================
  we canno t assign a value in interpolation it will give eror
   {{x=4}}   : error(binding cannot contain assignmnt at a column)
   
   we canot declare site like href=http,,,,,:
      if you want declare then go create variable in clss assign it
  
  
  property binding:
  ==================
  property binding 
  
  for html attributes once give we cannot change the value
  
    <input type="text" value="angular 10">
	
	inspect-> console->$0.getAttribute('value');  //angular10
	
	for DOM(data object model)
	
	<inout [id]="coueseId" type="text" value="angular js">

              here we give html value angular js and given binding [id] now chamge the values
			  
			  goto->class-> crete
			            public courseId="123";
						      if you check in the inspect the console
                                        
                                             $0.getAttribute('value');  // angular js(doesnt change)
                                         
										 $0.value;
										            // 123   (chamged the value)



class Binding:
=============
 
 
 
@Component({
  selector: 'app-test',
  template: `


  <h2>CLASS BINDING</h2>
  
  <h2 [class]="myText"> class level binding</h2>
  
  <h2 [class]="mySize">  USED class Level binding</h2>
  
  
  <!-- condion based binding-->

  <h2 [class.TextStyle]="required"> by using conditional used class binding</h2>
  
  <!-- if we want provide multiple classes in isngle binding-->
  <!-- ng is the custome directive if we want use more we use ng-->
  
  <h2 [ngClass]="Group"> Custome classes by Using ng</h2>
  

,
styles: [ 
   

   h2{

    text-align:center;
    font-size:30px;
   }
   
   .TextColor{
        
		color:green;
   
   }
   
   .TextSize{

    font-size:60px;
   }
   .TextStyle{
   
   font-style:italic;
   }
   
   `
  ]
})
export class TestComponent implements OnInit {


// by using conditional

 public required=true;

//create class binding

public mySize="TextSize";

public myText="TextColor";


 public Group=
  {
    "TextColor": this.required, "TextSize" :this.required, "TextStyle" :this.required
  }
 
 
  ngOnInit(): void {
  }

  

}



Style Binding:
-----------

@Component({
  selector: 'app-test',
  template: `
    <!--style bing we cn set the the value double with in single -->
    <h2 [style.color]="'blue'">STYLE BINDING</h2>


    <!-- by using property-->

    <h2 [style.color]="myColor"> Style binding by using property</h2>

   
    <!-- by using conditional way-->
    <!--if it is true print green other wise red -->

    <h2 [style.color]="required ? 'green':'red'"> Style binding by using property</h2>
  
    <!-- by using more properties way/ if we want apply multiple classes we should apply custom directory ng-->

    <h2 [ngStyle]="myStyles"> Style binding GROUP of properties</h2>

  `,
  styles: [
   `
   




   `
  ]
})
export class TestComponent implements OnInit {

  public myColor="orange";

  public required=true;

  public myStyles={ color:"brown", fontStyle:"italic", fontSize:"40px"}
  
  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
  }

  

}

Event Binding:
===============
in the event binding is used to define

           here view------------------------>> class

create one button whenever you click the button the process is running from view to to class

   in the button crete click assign to onclick
      and create onclic() method 
	     in  the onclick method  write as local variable value
           but it is class leval variable if we want display class level variable use"interpolation"		 




@Component({
  selector: 'app-test',
  template: `
   
  <!-- event binding-->

  <br><br>

  <button (click)="onclick()" type="button">click me</button>

 <h2>{{greetings}}</h2>

  `,
  styles: [
   `
   
  h2{

    text-align:center;
    font-size:40px;
  }



   `
  ]
})
export class TestComponent implements OnInit {

   public greetings="";
  
  
  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
  }
 
   onclick(){
     this.greetings="wecome to Event binding";
   }
  

}
