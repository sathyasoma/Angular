two way data binding:
====================

two way data binding is used to send data from view to  class to again to view

view==>class==>view     (two way data binding)

* if you want use two way data binding we need to import     ngModel froms  present angular forms

**we need to import in app module.ts file and aslo copy in import place.


ex:

view:
-----

<input [(ngModel)]="variablename" type="text">

<button type="button"> click me</button>

<br><br>

{{variable name}}



class:
=====

varialename="";        ----> this variable name mention to display in view use "interpolation" aswellas in "ngmodule"
